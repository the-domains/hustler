      President Obama has warned that ATMs and airport check-in kiosks are
      contributing to high unemployment. Sen. Marco Rubio said that the central
      challenge of our times is "to ensure that the rise of the machines is not
      the fall of the worker."

  expectation that the banks would be nationalised, revived briefly a
