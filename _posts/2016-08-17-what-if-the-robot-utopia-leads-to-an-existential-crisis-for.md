      (AI), which has made our lives easier but also stirred some worries as to
      how human workers will be affected.

  Imagine a human being born on the cusp of a robotic revolution. Let's call him
  Bill. At first, when the machines take over the economy, Bill is stoked. He

  TV. Eventually, he gets bored.
