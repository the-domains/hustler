  2021. This is the year that the 2015 International Technology Roadmap for
  Semiconductors, released earlier this month, predicts that it will no longer
  be economically viable for companies to continue shrinking the size of
  transistors, the fundamental units of computer processors that have
  historically dictated the maximum component density that can be squished onto
  a wafer of silicon.
