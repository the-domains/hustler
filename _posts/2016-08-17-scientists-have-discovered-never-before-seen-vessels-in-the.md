  Scientists in the US have discovered a new series of lymphatic vessels in the
  body that link the brain to the immune system - a connection researchers had
  previously thought didn't exist. The discovery could not only prompt a rewrite
  of the textbooks, it might also lead to a new understanding of how our immune
  system influences our brain and our behaviour.
