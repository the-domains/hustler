  The Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) is a modular, DIY, low-cost,
  high-performance platform that allows for the easy fabrication of the 50
  different Industrial Machines that it takes to build a small, sustainable
  civilization with modern comforts. We're developing open source industrial
  machines that can be made at a fraction of commercial costs, and sharing our
  designs online for free.
