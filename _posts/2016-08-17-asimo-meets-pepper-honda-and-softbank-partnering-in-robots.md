      Take a look around any workplace, and it's hard not to see the radical
      transformations revolutionizing the way we work. One of those major
      changes is the evolution of modern robotics, or artificial intelligence
      (AI), which has made our lives easier but also stirred some worries as to
      how human workers will be affected.

  Automaker Honda Motor Co. and internet company SoftBank said Thursday they
  will work together on artificial intelligence to develop products with sensors
  and cameras that can converse with drivers. Tokyo-based Honda's robotics
  division went through some soul-searching when Asimo was widely criticized as
  useless when it could not help with the nuclear accident at the Fukushima
  plant, which sank into meltdowns after the March 2011 tsunami.
