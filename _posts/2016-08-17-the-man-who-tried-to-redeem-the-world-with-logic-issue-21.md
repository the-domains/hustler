  Walter Pitts was used to being bullied. He'd been born into a tough family in
  Prohibition-era Detroit, where his father, a boiler-maker, had no trouble
  raising his fists to get his way. The neighborhood boys weren't much better.
  One afternoon in 1935, they chased him through the streets until he ducked
  into the local library to hide.
