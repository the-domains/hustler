  Stephen Hawking is so generous a genius that he wants to share the wealth. He
  believes "ordinary people" can be trained to "think like a genius" about the
  really big questions. His new six-part PBS series, "Genius by Stephen
  Hawking," borrows from reality TV to devise a science show full of games and
  puzzles that is suspenseful and accessible.
